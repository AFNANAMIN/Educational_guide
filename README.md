# AI/ML Educational Guide
An educational guide on how to get started in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) as documented by the [Pakistan.AI](https://www.facebook.com/PakistandotAI) group. Many such guides already exist on the Internet. However, the circumstances of Pakistan are different and hence require a customised guide. This guide assumes that readers have some exposure to programming and understand high school level math (Intermediate/Matriculation level Math across all path divisions). However, if you have no previous programming experience it is recommended that you go through this [Medium blog post](https://medium.com/@amandalmia18/guide-for-deep-learning-aspirants-with-focus-on-non-computer-science-students-87b1f7b3f4b9). At the very least you must do one programming course to continue on to the courses mentioned. We recommend Harvard's [CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x).
