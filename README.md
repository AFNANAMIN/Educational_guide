# AI/ML Educational Guide
An educational guide on how to get started in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) as documented by the [Pakistan.ai](https://www.facebook.com/PakistandotAI) group. Many such guides already exist on the Internet. However, the circumstances of Pakistan are different and hence require a customised guide. This guide assumes that readers have some exposure to programming and understand high school level math (Intermediate/Matriculation level Math across all path divisions). However, if you have no previous programming experience it is recommended that you go through this [Medium blog post](https://medium.com/@amandalmia18/guide-for-deep-learning-aspirants-with-focus-on-non-computer-science-students-87b1f7b3f4b9). At the very least you must do one programming course to continue on to the courses below. We recommend Harvard's [CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x).

[Pakistan.ai](https://www.facebook.com/PakistandotAI) is constantly on the look out for individuals who can make the guide better so if you have attempted some great course or have some honest advice for the Pakistan Data Science & AI community then please submit a pull request and contribute to the guide!
