# Educational Guide
An educational guide on how to get started in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence as documented from the [Pakistan.ai](https://www.facebook.com/PakistandotAI) group. Many such guides already existent on the internet however the circumstances of Pakistan are different and hence require a customised guide. 

## Getting Started
Most of the greatest feats of AI today ([Alpha Go](https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/), [Google Search Engine](https://www.wired.com/2016/02/ai-is-changing-the-technology-behind-google-searches/) and etc) are possible due to a domain called Machine Learning. This specific domain focuses on machines teaching themselves how to do a certain task (as defined by the programmer) based on data available i.e. the machine learns from the data hence the name "Machine Learning". Please note that this guide involves.

### [Machine Learning on Coursera by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) (highly recommended)
Access: Audit the course or apply for financial aid (2-3 weeks approval time)
This course is considered the best introduction to machine learning by the entire global community for its simplicity and concept-based learning.   
Advantages: 
- Andrew Ng dives into the algorithms used in machine learning by keeping mathematical involvement to a minimum whilst delivering all the intuition behind the mathematics used
- Andrew Ng delivers practical advice on how to approach and solve machine learning problems throughout the course 

Disadvatages:
- Delivering mathematical intuition becomes difficult due to the increased mathematical complexity in certain algorithms
- Octave/MATLAB is used for programming assignments in the course - a language that is now used less within the machine learning community

### [Machine Learning on Coursera by Carlos Guestrin and Emily Fox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-foundations)
Access: Audit the course or apply for financial aid (2-3 weeks approval time)
