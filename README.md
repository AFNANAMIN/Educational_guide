# Educational Guide
An educational guide on how to get started in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence as documented from the [Pakistan.ai](https://www.facebook.com/PakistandotAI) group. Many such guides already existent on the internet however the circumstances of Pakistan are different and hence require a customised guide. 

## Getting Started
Most of the greatest feats of AI today ([Alpha Go](https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/), [Google Search Engine](https://www.wired.com/2016/02/ai-is-changing-the-technology-behind-google-searches/) and etc) are possible due to a domain called Machine Learning. This specific domain focuses on machines teaching themselves how to do a certain task (as defined by the programmer) based on data available i.e. the machine learns from the data hence the name "Machine Learning". Due to the mathematical nature of the domain this guide involves mathematical courses as well.

#### [Machine Learning on Coursera by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) (highly recommended)
Access: Audit the course or apply for financial aid (2-3 weeks approval time)   
This course is considered the best introduction to machine learning by the entire global community for its simplicity and concept-based learning.   
Advantages: 
- Andrew Ng dives into the algorithms used in machine learning by keeping mathematical involvement to a minimum whilst delivering all the intuition behind the mathematics used
- Students are expected to code the machine learning algorithms themselves
- Andrew Ng delivers practical advice on how to approach and solve machine learning problems throughout the course 

Disadvatages:
- Delivering mathematical intuition becomes difficult due to the increased mathematical complexity in certain algorithms
- Octave/MATLAB is used for programming assignments in the course - a language that is now used less within the machine learning community

#### [Machine Learning on Coursera by Carlos Guestrin and Emily Fox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-foundations)
Access: Audit the course or apply for financial aid (2-3 weeks approval time)   
This course can be conisdered as an less intensive and shorter substitute for Andrew Ng's machine learning course.   
Advantages:
- Algorithms are explained but students are not required to code them themselves - focus is mainly on learning how to use libraries
- Python, a well used language in the data science community, is used throughout the assignments   

Disadvantages:
- Python libraries used are not open source
- No practical advice on how to approach and solve machine learning problems is given throughout the course

## Mathematics
Although Andrew Ng, Carlos and Emily intentially attempt to cover up the mathematics in order to not overwhelm beginners, students must not shy away from attempting to understand these topics in order to deepen their understanding regarding the subject. As the method of teaching in mathematics within Pakistan requires great improvement, it is strongly recommended that the following courses are taken by all participants.
