# Educational Guide
An educational guide on how to get started in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) as documented from the [Pakistan.ai](https://www.facebook.com/PakistandotAI) group. Many such guides already existent on the internet however the circumstances of Pakistan are different and hence require a customised guide. This guide assumes that readers have some exposure to programming and understand high school level math (inter/matric level math across all path divisions). Read on to [Getting Started](#getting-started) to decide your first course!   
However, if you have no previous programming experience it is recommended that you go through this [Medium blog post](https://medium.com/@amandalmia18/guide-for-deep-learning-aspirants-with-focus-on-non-computer-science-students-87b1f7b3f4b9). At the very least a student must do one programming course to continue on to the courses below. We recommend Harvard's [CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x) as an introductory programing course.   
[Pakistan.ai](https://www.facebook.com/PakistandotAI) is constantly on the look out for individuals who can make the guide better so if you have attempted some course that you feel has delivered great value then please submit a pull request and contribute to the guide!

## Getting Started
Most of the greatest feats of AI today ([Alpha Go](https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/), [Google Search Engine](https://www.wired.com/2016/02/ai-is-changing-the-technology-behind-google-searches/) and etc) are possible due to a subdomain in AI called Machine Learning. This specific domain focuses on machines teaching themselves how to do a certain task (as defined by the programmer) based on input data i.e. the machine learns from the data hence the name "Machine Learning". Due to the mathematical nature of ML this guide involves mathematical courses as well. It is strongly recommended that students complete them for a better understanding of the subject.

#### [Machine Learning on Coursera by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) (highly recommended)
Access: Audit / Financial aid (2-3 weeks approval time) / Payment   
This course is considered the best introduction to machine learning by the entire global community for its simplicity and concept-based learning.   
Advantages: 
- Andrew Ng dives into the algorithms used in machine learning by keeping mathematical involvement to a minimum whilst delivering all the intuition behind the mathematics used
- Students are expected to code the machine learning algorithms themselves
- Andrew Ng delivers practical advice on how to approach and solve machine learning problems throughout the course 

Disadvatages:
- Delivering mathematical intuition becomes difficult due to the increased mathematical complexity in certain algorithms
- Octave/MATLAB is used for programming assignments in the course (less recognised programming language within the machine learning community)

#### [Machine Learning on Coursera by Carlos Guestrin and Emily Fox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-foundations)
Access: Audit / Financial aid (2-3 weeks approval time) / Payment   
This course can be conisdered as a less intensive and shorter substitute for [Andrew Ng's machine learning course](#machine-learning-on-coursera-by-andrew-ng).   
Advantages:
- Algorithms are explained but students are not required to code them themselves - focus is mainly on learning how to use libraries
- Python, a well used language in the data science community, is used throughout the assignments   

Disadvantages:
- No practical advice on how to approach and solve machine learning problems is given throughout the course

## Mathematics
Although Andrew Ng, Carlos and Emily intentially attempt to cover up the mathematics in order to not overwhelm beginners, students must not shy away from attempting to understand these topics in order to deepen their understanding regarding the subject. As the method of teaching in mathematics within Pakistan requires great improvement, it is strongly recommended that the following courses are taken by all participants. One more thing to note - our focus within mathematics courses is mainly towards rigorous university courses rather than "not so rigorous" MOOC courses. This is due to the fact MOOCs tend to simplify mathematical content which leads to limited applicability of the content to real life situations.

#### [Probability at Harvard by Joe Blitzstein](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home)
Access: Free   
This course delivers an entire undergraduate exprience of studying at Harvard and introduces a rigorous and intuition-based introduction of probability and how it is applied.   
Advantages:
- Great insight is given into how probability exists in the real world and how it must be correctly applied to real life situations
- Exercises are provided

Disadvantages:
- Course is considered challenging by most students
- Difficult to follow the course if exercises are not attempted by students  

#### [Statistics and Probability by Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability)
Access: Free   
For those who find [Probability at Harvard by Joe Blitzstein](#probability-at-harvard-by-joe-blitzstein) challenging Khan Academy's courses serve as a less rigourous alternative with an increased focus on intuition.   
Advantages:
- Highly conceptual videos with focus on intuiton
- Exercises are provided

Disadvantages:
- Exercises are oversimplified and lack in real world applications - course does not deliver the skills required to apply concepts to real world applications

#### [Linear Algebra at MIT by Gilbert Strang](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/index.htm)
Access: Free   
This course delivers an entire undergraduate exprience of studying at MIT and introduces a rigorous and intuition-based introduction of linear algebra and how it is applied.   
Advantages:   
- Great insight is given into how linear algebra is relevant and how it must be correctly applied to real life situations
- Recitation videos are present - these videos walk you through a solution to a specific problem
- Exercises are provided

Disadvantages:
- Course is considered challenging by most students
- Difficult to follow the course if exercises are not attempted by students

#### [Linear Algebra by Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)
Access: Free   
For those who find [Linear Algebra at MIT by Gilbert Strang](#linear-algebra-at-mit-by-gilbert-strang) challenging Khan Academy's courses serve as a less rigourous alternative with an increased focus on intuition.   
Advantages:
- Highly conceptual videos with focus on intuiton
- Exercises are provided

Disadvantages:
- Exercises are oversimplified and lack in real world applications - course does not deliver the skills required to apply concepts to real world applications

#### [Essence of linear algebra by 3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)
Access: Free   
This Youtube playlist discusses the intuition of linear algebra from different perspectives and builds up understanding. It acts as great supplementary content to a course that a student is already currently doing in linear algebra.

## Deep Learning
Deep Learning (DL) is recongnised as a subdomain of ML and a wide majority of all modern applications of AI lie within this specific domain. DL can be considered as an extension of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) where the architecture of the neural network is tweaked. The greatest benefit of DL is that it eliminates the need of feature engineering as required in ML with the unfortunate drawback that increased computing power and more data is required. Most of today's computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) is based entirely on DL. An understanding of ML is highly recommended before attempting DL courses.

#### [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
Access: Audit / Financial aid (2-3 weeks approval time) / Payment   
This specialisation (a sequence of many courses) is considered as a logical extension from [Andrew Ng's machine learning course](#machine-learning-on-coursera-by-andrew-ng) and is recognised as the best introduction to deep learning by the entire global community for its simplicity and concept-based learning.   
Advantages: 
- Andrew Ng dives into the algorithms used in machine learning by keeping mathematical involvement to a minimum whilst delivering all the intuition behind the mathematics used
