# Importance of Mathematical rigor in Machine Learning

Within machine learning and all the fields related to it (data science, computer vision, NLP and etc) people usually come across 2 types of problems:
1) Problems where ready-made algorithms work
2) Problems where ready-made algorithms don't work   
Most companies that work in the ML domain work on problems of the second type. If this were not true then companies providing ML based services would not exist in the first place because then any developer could simply run a couple of functions (pfft... how difficult is it to copy a couple of functions? Just use Stack Overflow!) and get the required work done. So if you wanted to work at such a company, you would be required to implement algorithms on your own. At the bare minimum that requires a knowledge of statistics, linear algebra and calculus. If you have no idea about statistics chances are you won't even understand what's happening (not to mention actually implementing the actual formula) and if you have no knowledge of linear algebra chances are you'll write some code that will take days to execute as opposed to hours (linear algebra libraries allow you to write extremely efficient code that has the capacity to maximise the utiliztion of your processor along with any GPUs)

You've been presented with a problem that can be solved via ready-made algorithms. But hold on, should you use linear regression or neural nets? But there are so many type of neural nets, which one should you use? Technically speaking anomaly detection does the same thing as linear regression, so which one should you use? If you do choose anomaly detection with gaussian distribution then should you use the single-variate version or the multi-variate version? Is there any difference between the two? Oh, single variate assumes independence between variables. Hold on... what's independence? I also have all this data, how do I characterise it to fit the best possible machine learning model? You do that with distributions? What on earth is a distrubution?!   
All these questions are answered by having mathematical intuition of the algorithm. Guess how you get to understand that mathematical intuition!?
